## A Serverless AJAX Approach for Retrieving and Displaying Large Collections of Data

This is a simple, self-contained ColdFusion application that takes basic AJAX and XML to retrieve and display data sets on a web page. This was originally developed to display community organizations within metropolitan statistical areas (hence the name of the project) but the principles could be extrapolated across disciplines.

All identifying information has been removed from this repository but the application can easily be repurposed and utilized in other contexts. The schema file can be modified as desired (and the XSL style sheet as well).

Though this should still be functional and could be repurposed, it is presented for informational purposes only, and I accept no responsibility for data loss or other adverse consequences of the use of this software.
